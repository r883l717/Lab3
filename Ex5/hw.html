						I am a junior student, and I usually like to read books, browse webpage materials, learn new knowledge, and make some small plans for future graduation. Like most people, they are a little confused about the future. When something suddenly pops up in my mind about a few years ago, I can't help but think about myself at that time, and everything about that once gradually emerges. There are some pictures, suddenly desperately trying to find something in that memory point, the thoughts in my head have long been indulged in memories during the search, and those unforgettable feelings are forgotten at this moment. It came out, I think the last search result may not be important anymore, because the sudden thought of something I wanted to find made me suddenly quiet, the inexplicable thoughts spread, and it brought me back Now that I can't feel the kind of sudden heartbeat, it seems that the old drawer is opened, which is full of the original growth, green, unfortunate, and the feeling that I can't help but laugh suddenly when I think of it, I may think The one who laughed at that time, or perhaps the time with a regretful ending, was really nostalgic.
